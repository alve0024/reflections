# When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> Pretty much any project, so you can have other people contributing with your code or just to keep it safe in case, you lost your laptop.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> Sometimes you don't have internet connection.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks = The repository clone procedure on Github is called fork, which is a copy from the original repository to your account
clones = It's can between to local repository, however it's more common to be a clone you make from a remote repository to your local repository
branches = Are labels you create during the development process, where you can change or add new code, that it's not stable yet, without interfer on the main code on master branch.

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
>> Even offline you can make a merge to keep working on your branch with up-to-date code
