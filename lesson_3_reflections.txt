# When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> Pretty much any project, so you can have other people contributing with your code or just to keep it safe in case, you lost your laptop.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> Sometimes you don't have internet connection.
